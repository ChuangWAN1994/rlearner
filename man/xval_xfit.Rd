\usage{
xval_xfit(x, y, model_specs, economy = T, weights = NULL, k_folds_cf = 5,
  k_folds = 5, select_by = "best")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric matrix of features}

\item{y}{a logical vector for probabilistic classificaton or numeric vector for regression.}

\item{model_specs}{a data structure specifying which learning algorithms, hyperparameters should 
be cross validated over, and which additional arguments should be 
passed to each learner. This should be a list where the names of each element are valid \pkg{caret}
methods (learning algorithms). The list element corresponding to each learning algorithm should itself
be a list of two elements named \code{tune_grid} (hyperparameters) and \code{extra_args}. 
\code{tune_grid} should be a valid \pkg{caret} tune grid of hyperparameters corresponing to the learning algorithm.
\code{extra_args} is a named list of additional arguments to be passed on to the learning algorithm. See example.}

\item{economy}{flag that determines if "economy" or "deluxe" cross-validated cross-estimation is performed}

\item{weights}{optional case weights}

\item{k_folds_cf}{number of cross-fitting folds. Unecessary if \code{economy=T}.}

\item{k_folds}{number of cross-validation folds}

\item{select_by}{optimization method to use for cross-validation: either \code{"best"} for minimum cross-validation
error or \code{"oneSE"} for the one-standard-error (1-SE) rule. The implementaion of the 1-SE rule for learners with
multiple hyperparameters is governed by \pkg{caret} and may be ad-hoc for some learners. See: \code{\link[caret]{?caret::oneSE}}.}
}
\details{
Provides both a "deluxe" version and an "economy" version. The deluxe version 
preserves data-splitting independence relations. The "economy version" leaks information from the held-out folds 
into the predictions on the held-out folds via the hyperparameter selection: data-splitting independence assumptions 
do not hold and theoretical guarentees do not follow, but the models fit more quickly. Internal cross validation is
performed via \code{\link{learner_cv}}.
